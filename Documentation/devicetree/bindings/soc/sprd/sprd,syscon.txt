UNISOC PMIC syscon driver bindings

This driver is designed for that pmic sub-modules can read/write pmic global register easily.

Required properties:
- compatible:
  -"sprd,sc27xx-syscon" for SC27XX series pmic syscon
  -"sprd,ump962x-syscon" for UMP962x main pmic syscon
  -"sprd,ump9621-syscon" for UMP9621 sub-pmic syscon
  -"sprd,ump9622-syscon" for UMP9622 sub-pmic syscon

- reg: Specifies the physical offset address(relative to pmic base register address) for specific pmic register.

Example:
	syscon@2000 {
		compatible = "sprd,ump962x-syscon";
		reg = <0x2004>, <0x2008>;
	};
