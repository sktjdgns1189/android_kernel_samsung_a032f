UNISOC SoCs UMP96XX PMIC MFD driver

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of following:
	"sprd,ump9620"
	"sprd,ump9621"
	"sprd,ump9622"
- reg: Specifies PMICs chip select signal for spi framework.

Optional properties:
- size-cells: size of cells required to define a sys module address size on.
- address-cells: number of address cells for the PMIC's subnodes.
- #interrupt-cells: be identical to the that of the parent interrupt.
- interrupt-controller :be identical to describe the PMIC that have interrupt signal.
- spi-max-frequency: max frequency of spi/adi bus for pmic.

Example:
	ump9620_pmic: pmic@0 {
		compatible = "sprd,ump9620";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <26000000>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
	};
