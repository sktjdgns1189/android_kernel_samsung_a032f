Spreadtrum SPI Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of following:
	"sprd,sc9860-spi",
	"sprd,sc9863-spi",
	"sprd,ums9620-spi".
- reg: Offset and length of SPI controller register space.
- interrupts: Should contain SPI interrupt.
- clock-names: Should contain following entries:
	"spi" for SPI clock,
	"source" for SPI source (parent) clock,
	"enable" for SPI module enable clock.
- clocks: List of clock input name strings sorted in the same order
	as the clock-names property.
- #address-cells: The number of cells required to define a chip select
	address on the SPI bus. Should be set to 1.
- #size-cells: Should be set to 0.

Example:
spi0: spi@70a00000{
	compatible = "sprd,sc9863-spi";
	reg = <0 0x70a00000 0 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 7 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clock-names = "enable", "spi", "source";
	clocks = <&apapb_gate CLK_SPI0_EB>,
		 <&ap_clk CLK_AP_SPI0>, <&pll CLK_TWPLL_192M>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	status = "disabled";
